              The Coronavirus originates from Wuhan, China. It spreads primarily
              through contact with an infected person when they cough or sneeze.
              It also spreads when a person touches a surface or object that has
              the virus on it, then touches their eyes, nose or mouth.

            <ul class="info">
              <li>
                High temperature – this means you feel hot to touch on your

              </li>
              <li>
                A new, continuous cough – this means coughing a lot for more
                than an hour, or 3 or more coughing episodes in 24 hours (if you
                usually have a cough, it may be worse than usual). Do not go to
                a GP surgery, pharmacy or hospital.
